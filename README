knife-clodo is a knife plugin for Clodo.Ru API.

It uses fog library to interact with API.

Starting from fog-1.1.2, fog's provider for clodo presented
in upstream Git, so installation and setup is as simple as 
running "gem install knife-clodo" from command line, and
adding next lines in your knife's configuration file:

knife[:clodo_username]		=	'your@registration.email.net'     # Your email used to authorise in clodo.ru billing.
knife[:clodo_api_key]		=	'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' # Your API key
knife[:clodo_api_auth_url]	=	'testapi.kh.clodo.ru'             # Domain name of API server.

Next type in command line:

knife clodo server

knife clodo server start --server=10474
